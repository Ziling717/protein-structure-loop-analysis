    "- This notebooks records all attempts made during the thesis extensional exploration progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- My final goal is to identify key residues on the loop and find interactions with ligands and simulate the dynamic state of loop and reveal the truth of bewteen enzymatic specificity and novel structural loop. I hope to gain skills and experience in protein exploration using programming skills, bioinformatic tools. I believe this continuous learning journey will equip me with more solid knowledge and experience in protein engineering and bioinformatics.\n",
