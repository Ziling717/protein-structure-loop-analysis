1. Project title
- Protein structure prediction and loop dynamics exploration - a self-directed bioinformatics project
- This is a self-dircted bioinformatics project that extends the work from my master's thesis. It continues my exploration of the relationship between an enzyme's function and its structural features, especially focusing on a novel loop region.

2. Background 
- The target enzyme BfIMTD is a dextranase from GH49. What makes this enzyme unique is its **product specificity**. It produces isomaltotroise specifically while most other enzymes from GH49 generate mixtures of oligosaccharides.
- Structurally, BfIMTA has a novel loop outside its catalytic tunnel while others might not possess. After some bioinformatic exploration, I suspected that this loop could be essential for BfIMTD's unusual product function. 
So I proposed the hypothesis that the presence of this loop positively correlates with the enzyme's product specificity. 
- During my master's research, I validated this hypothesis with both computational and experimental attempts:
  - Bioinformatics: multiple sequence alignment, structure alignment, structure modeling, database mining, and docking.
  - Positive validation: identified more enzymes with similar loops and confirmed that they showed similar activities.
  - Negative validation: truncated the loop in BfIMTD, which led to the loss of its original product specificity.
These results supported the hypothesis.
- However, I knew these validations were not enough. I still want to understand how exactly the enzyme achieves this specificity. Which residues on the loop are tightly involved in the activity? What interactions and conformations matter during the activity? And how does the loop affect the action at the molecular level?
- The curiosity has continued.
  - I am eagar to learn and apply computational tools to explore protein structure-function relationships more deeply.
  - These questions often wander in my head: What do other enzymes do? How do they perform their unique funcions? What enables them to behave so precisely? And what can we learn from them to design new functions?
  - I hope to reveal more underlying principles behind enzyme behavior and apply these understandings to our practical problems.
- To move forward, I have been learning new tools and methods. For example, I completed Coursera's Machine learning specialization in July, and now I am learning relevant bioinformatic tools, molecular simulation tools, and data analysis methods to extend my skills.
- Former results from master's thesis are included in [doc].
- New explorations included data, notebooks, and scripts are shown in [data], [notebooks], [scripts].
- Updated results are in [results].
- This repository is still under active updating.
